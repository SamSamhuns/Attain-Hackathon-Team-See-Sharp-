# Attain-Hackathon-Team-See-Sharp-Predemic

Python scikit based application to make predictions on the likelihood of outbreaks of epidemics based on past epidemic and pandemic data from the WHO.
Supervised Machine Learning using Sci-kit learn from the Python Library. 

All training data and python files are inside ATTAIN_HACKATHONE_FinalVersion.zip.
The machine learning algorithm has to be trained before being used to predict probability of future outbreaks.
Results are outputted in the python terminal from 0 - being least likely to 4 - being most likely.
